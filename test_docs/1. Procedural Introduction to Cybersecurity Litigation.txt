hello everybody\num so moving into this next week uh in\nthe course we're going to be moving into\na unit called cyber security litigation\nessentially what this unit is going to\ncover is you know when a data breach\nhappens and\num\nthe company maybe you know didn't do\neverything they were supposed to do in\norder to protect people's information\nwe're going to be covering this week how\nindividuals can sue those companies in\norder to get monetary damages or some\nother sort of relief for the harm that\nis caused to them you know we've talked\nabout that a little bit when we've\ntalked about some of the other laws and\nin the other units up to this point but\nmost of our Focus has been on how\nRegulators or government actors can\npunish companies for failing to protect\npeople's information uh whether that be\nbecause it was taken in a data breach or\nbecause they didn't follow privacy laws\nhere we're going to be focusing on how\npeople can take recourse against\ncompanies when their information is\ntaken and so this unit is going to be\nsplit up into two parts the first part\nof the unit and we're really going to\ncover kind of a lot of procedural things\nyou know how does you know we're going\nto go over the key\num kind of components of a lawsuit just\nso you understand sort of the structure\nand process that you know the courts go\nthrough when someone brings a case and\nwe're also going to talk about kind of\nwhat are some of the requirements for\npeople to get into court in the first\nplace from a procedural standpoint the\nsecond part of the unit will be more\nsubstantive in which we will be covering\nthe actual causes of action that\nindividuals can bring against companies\nuh if they meet the procedural\nrequirements\nso on the docket for right now we're\ngoing to go over just kind of a brief\nintroduction to the unit as I mentioned\nthen we'll discuss key procedural stages\nof civil lawsuits uh Chief among those\nis going to be a requirement of article\n3 standing uh and we'll go over that in\nmore detail kind of in standing is\nessentially all about whether someone is\nallowed to sue somebody in court uh so\nwe'll cover some key Supreme Court\nrulings that sort of Define The Contours\nof standing in the context of cyber\nsecurity and data breaches and data\nprivacy in particular uh once we look at\nthat we're going to look at some lower\ncourt rulings uh so from like uh the\nfederal appellate courts because what\nyou'll learn when we look at these three\nSupreme Court cases is that there isn't\na lot of clarity on what constitutes\nstanding in the wake of a data breach\nand so we'll look at some lower courts\nthat have taken a very broad view\num of one of the components of standing\nand then we'll look at some courts as a\ncase where the court has taken a more\nnarrow view making it harder for people\nto get in the front door a essentially\nof the Court\num so after that we will talk about two\nother requirements to standing\num that the uh that the injury be fairly\ntraceable to the defendant and that it\nbe redressable by the court so something\nwe'll talk about is standing really has\nthree components there must be some sort\nof harm or what we call an injury in\nfact that injury needs to be fairly\ntraceable to the defendant's conduct\nbecause it wouldn't be fair to Sue that\nperson if they were not the cause of the\nharm and then the last requirement is\nthat whatever you're bringing to court\nwhatever you're suing for and hoping to\nget there needs to be redressability\nmeaning that the court has the ability\nto award you what you're asking for in\norder to ameliorate your harm you know\nand that's what bringing a civil uh case\nis all about uh it's all about uh you\nknow you\nif you explore kind of the legal cases a\nlittle bit more you'll hear the phrase\nmaking someone whole again and basically\nwhat that means is typically it means\nthey get some amount of money that has\nbeen deemed adequate to compensate them\nfor the injury that they've suffered but\nif the court isn't able to do that or if\nthere is no way to compensate somebody\nfor their injury then we would say that\nthat is not a redressable\num that that would not be redressable\nand that is one of the components of\nstanding so we will look at those three\ncomponents both from the Supreme Court\nlevel and then some of the lower court\nlevels interpreting those those higher\ncourt rulings and then we'll conclude\num the article 3 kind of discussion the\nprocedural requirements that we'll be\ntalking about um and then as I mentioned\nthat will all of this here on this slide\nwill cover the first part of the unit\nthe procedural components of of cyber\nsecurity litigation before moving into\nthe substantive discussion of what\nactual Claims can be brought against\ncompanies\nso let's start off with just kind of a\nbrief introduction here into the unit uh\none thing that you know we've already\ntalked about before uh in in our\nprevious lessons is that the FTC is the\nleading regulator when it comes to data\nsecurity as we've seen time and again\nthe FTC and other government bodies\nbring a lot of actions and perform a lot\nof Investigations to go after companies\nthat violate data security laws or\nrequirements that being said businesses\nare still just going to be concerned\nabout the threat of what we call class\naction litigation arising from data\nbreaches and other cyber security\nincidents and so when I say class action\nlitigation I'm sure you've heard it on\ntelevision shows and things like that\nbut basically that happens when a large\ngroup of people who have suffered the\nsame harm from the same person or entity\nkind of band together and Sue that\nentity for a lot of money and so that's\nvery common in the data breach context\nbecause when a data breach happens you\nknow you often hear you know a hundred\nthousand people Social Security numbers\nwere released or a million people you\nknow that we're talking really high\nvolume here uh where it wouldn't really\nmake sense for each of these individual\npeople to sue the company individually\nso the law has a mechanism by which we\ncan group all those people together and\nwe can sue that company in one court\ncase\nand that is very costly for companies\nwe're typically talking about\nmulti-million dollar payouts when these\ncases typically settle they typically\ndon't go all the way through to a full\ntrial uh but it's still a lot of\nresources a lot of money for the\ncompanies and uh it just adds to the\nbill really\num from these cyber security incidents\nyou know they might get fined by the FTC\na couple million dollars and then they\nhave to settle a class action litigation\nuh where they pay out another couple\nmillion dollars\none thing that you might want to think\nabout as we go through this unit is when\nit comes to class action litigation we\nwon't get into it in too much detail but\nsomething that I I find to be pretty\ninteresting is a lot of times in class\naction litigation you got a lot of\npeople and a lot of money and it looks\nlike a lot but when you do when you\ndivide you know two million dollars\nup between you know a couple hundred\nthousand people\neach individual person isn't really\ngetting a large sum of money and one\nthing you might want to think about is\nare people being adequately compensated\nwhen these data breaches happen\nespecially the people who actually have\ntheir identity stolen you know when\nsomeone has their identity stolen they\ncan lose a lot of money and then they\nyeah maybe they'll get you know sixty\nthousand dollars or something like that\nas a payout but they may have lost a lot\nmore money from that uh and so\nquery whether or not these class action\nlawsuits\nreally serve the purpose that\nreally serve the right purpose I mean\nthey make things efficient and they make\nit easier I think you know maybe also\nmaybe on some level for the companies\nbecause they only have one lawsuit to\nconsider but it might be worthwhile to\nthink about whether or not individuals\nare being adequately compensated not\nreally that's more of a tangent but for\nthose of you who are interested in this\ntopic that is a rabbit hole you could go\ndown kind of in your own time\num and you know if you find anything\ninteresting you know please bring it to\nmy attention I'd be happy to discuss it\nwith all you but\num just something to think about\nso anyway back onto the main track of\nthe lecture here uh as we'll get into\nlater essentially the way these class\naction litigation\num of these class action lawsuits arise\nare from old common law claims so common\nlaw is\num uh\ndistinguished from what we'll call civil\nlaw common law is laws that developed\nover time that were not passed by a by a\nlegislature by a congress the courts you\nknow over time have created these laws\nand over time what changes them are\nCourt opinions that is very different\nfrom statutory law or civil law where we\nhave a code where Congress passes a law\nthat says here are the things you're\nallowed to do and not do and if you\nviolate these things then you can be\nsued so the common law is what we had\nfor a very long time we do still have it\num\num uh you know in various different ways\nin the United States but we also have a\ncivil law as well a statutory code-based\nlaw\nbut anyway these common law claims like\nnegligence misrepresentation and breach\nof contract uh were have been adapted uh\nto cover the cyber security data breach\ncontext so again what you're going to\nsee throughout this unit is how we're\ntaking old laws and we're again we're\nretrofitting them we're adapting them to\napply to Modern technological\ncircumstances\nalso what we're going to see are private\nactions available from positive law or\nstatutory law like some of the state\nconsumer protection statutes that we've\ntalked about already in the Privacy\nsection uh like the California law we\ndiscussed and things like that there are\nalso private rights of action that get\ncreated for people in those laws as well\nso you have two different avenues that\nthese cases are being brought under and\nso plaintiff's lawyers increasingly look\nto put together class action litigation\nand seek large damages from these\ncompanies when they believe they fail to\nadequately Safeguard consumer data\nas a plaintiff's lawyer you typically\nget a cut a percentage cut of the\noverall settlement and so this can be\nquite\nlucrative for attorneys if they can put\ntogether a successful class action\nlawsuit and so what we're going to see\nis after these high-profile data\nbreaches these plaintiff's lawyers that\nkind of come out of the woodwork and you\nknow they put it they they reach out to\nall the people who had their information\ntaken and they say hey join this class\naction you might get a ton of money if\nwe win and um and then they get a lot of\nmoney uh when they eventually prevail\nso don't worry too much about the the\ncommon law stuff and the the the\npositive statutory loss stuff yet we\nwill get to that later in the unit we're\ngoing to talk more now about uh the\nprocedural issues that uh confront\nplaintiffs in this context so I'm going\nto stop this video here\num that provides a good introduction and\nthen in the next video I'll go over the\nkey procedural stages of civil lawsuits\n
